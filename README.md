This project is the work of [Tim Smart](https://github.com/tim-smart) and is a derivative work of [JavaScript-ID3-Reader](https://github.com/aadsm/JavaScript-ID3-Reader).

Tim Smart's repository doesn't have an issues section anymore and I have no intention to maintain or continue the work on this derivative project because I do not have the time to maintain a different fork.

I would like in the future to add node support to JavaScript-ID3-Reader but unfortunately time has been an issue, pull requests are more than welcomed though.
